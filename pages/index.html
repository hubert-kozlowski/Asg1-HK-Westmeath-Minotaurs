      <h2>Welcome to the Westmeath Minotaurs</h2>
      <p>
        American Football is the fastest growing sport in Ireland for a
        reason. Intense, hard hitting, strategic, and challenging. There is no
        other team sport like it. On every play every player is critical to
        the success of the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        All sizes, shapes, skill levels, and athletic backgrounds are welcome.
        There are 88 positions required on a team; all with unique
        requirements. We will find you a role; you will contribute. The
        Minotaurs staff will coach and develop your football skills from
        scratch to a high level. All you need to do is provide the commitment.
