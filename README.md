# Westmeath Minotaurs — Web Authoring Assignment 1

**Student:** Hubert Kozlowski  
**Course:** Web Authoring, Moate Business College  
**Assignment:** ASG1-HK

This is my Assignment 1 for Web Authoring class — a responsive sports team website featuring the fictional Westmeath Minotaurs. The site demonstrates modern CSS techniques, accessibility best practices, and mobile-first responsive design using semantic HTML and a single comprehensive stylesheet.

## Assignment Features

- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Accessibility:** Focus states, reduced-motion support, semantic HTML structure
- **Modern CSS:** Custom properties (variables), advanced selectors, animations
- **Performance:** Single CSS file, optimized images, minimal dependencies
- **Cross-browser:** Works on modern browsers with graceful degradation

## Technical Highlights

- CSS Variables for theming and consistent spacing/colors
- Responsive video embeds using padding-bottom technique
- CSS-only image swapping for navigation buttons
- Sticky table headers for data tables
- Float-based text wrapping with clearfix fallbacks

## File Structure

- `style.css` — main stylesheet (variables, components, responsive rules)
- `pages/` — HTML pages (index, about, join, game matchups)
- `images/` — team logos, navigation buttons, hero images

## Assignment Requirements Covered

- **Semantic HTML5:** Header, nav, main, section, article structure
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Responsive layouts without frameworks
- **Accessibility:** WCAG focus indicators, reduced motion support
- **Mobile-First:** Breakpoints at 700px, 800px, 1000px, 1200px
- **Performance:** Single CSS file, optimized asset loading

## Documentation

- `CSS_GUIDE.md` — technical notes about CSS patterns and implementation details
- `THEME.md` — color system and theming approach
- `USAGE.md` — setup instructions and accessibility checklist

## Open Source Usage

## Accessibility Features

- Focus styles use `:focus-visible` for keyboard navigation
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for motion-sensitive users
- High contrast colors and meaningful link text
- Semantic markup for screen readers
